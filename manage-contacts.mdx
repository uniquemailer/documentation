## Managing the contacts
You can manage the subscribers in contact groups so you can filter and send the emails. 

### Contact Groups
The Contact Groups feature allows you to efficiently manage and organize your email recipients. Instead of manually entering individual email addresses, you can create groups of contacts and send emails to entire groups with a single click.

1.  Navigate to the Contact Groups page.
2.  Click the "Create Group" button.
3.  Give your group a name (e.g., "Marketing Team", "Customers").
4.  Start adding email addresses to the group:
    -  Manually enter email addresses one by one.
    -   Import a CSV file containing a list of email addresses.
    -   Use the available search function to find and add existing contacts.

<strong>Benefits of Using Contact Groups</strong>

-   Time-saving: Efficiently manage and send emails to multiple recipients.
-   Organization: Keep your contacts organized and easily accessible.
-   Accuracy: Reduce the risk of errors when entering email addresses.

By utilizing Contact Groups, you can streamline your email sending process and improve overall efficiency.    

## How to add, edit and delete contacts
After creating the contact groups, you can add some contact. A contact contains:

 - name
 - last name
 - email
 - contact group

All contacts must be grouped in different groups. You can add the same email to many groups. But all contact groups must have unique emails.
