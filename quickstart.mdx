## Setup your development

Please refer to [installation documention](/installation)

## Create your first template

To start working on Mailer, you must create at least one template. You may start to define the placeholders akaâ€”variables in your template. There are two kinds on variables

* Public Placeholders

* Sensitive placeholders aka. private

If you don't want to store sensitive data in the database, you may define your variables in the sensitive placeholders field.&#x20;



The following screenshot shows sharp differences between public and private variables. While sending an email including a serial number which is sensitive information, we may avoid saving this data in the database and audit log.&#x20;
