## Setup your development

Please refer to [installation documention](/installation)

### Create your first template

To start working on Mailer, you must create at least one template. You may start to define the placeholders akaâ€”variables in your template. There are two kinds on variables

* Public Placeholders

* Sensitive placeholders aka. private

If you don't want to store sensitive data in the database, you may define your variables in the sensitive placeholders field.&#x20;



The following screenshot shows sharp differences between public and private variables. While sending an email including a serial number which is sensitive information, we may avoid saving this data in the database and audit log.&#x20;

We may also add the email title, HTML and TEXT template.&#x20;

### Update the contact list

If you have a pre-defined list of email addresses that you frequently send emails to, you can streamline your process by creating a contact group. This will allow you to easily target a specific group of recipients without needing to manually input each email address into your API call.

**To create a contact group:**

1. **Define Your Group:** Determine the criteria for your group (e.g., "Newsletter Subscribers," "VIP Customers").

2. **Add Members:** Add the email addresses of the recipients you want to include in the group.

3. **Save the Group:** Save your group with a descriptive name.

**Once your contact group is created, you can use it in your API calls to efficiently send bulk emails.**

**Benefits of Using Contact Groups:**

* **Efficiency:** Save time and effort by avoiding manual email address input.

* **Accuracy:** Reduce the risk of errors in email addresses.

* **Organization:** Keep your recipient lists organized and easy to manage.

By leveraging contact groups, you can simplify your email sending process and ensure that your messages reach the right people.

### Creating a Service to Send Your Emails

Once you've designed your email template, the next step is to create a service. This service will collect the necessary data and deliver your emails to the specified inboxes.

**To create a service, follow these steps:**

1. **Choose Your Email Format:**

   * **HTML:** Ideal for rich, visually appealing emails with images, formatting, and links.

   * **Text:** Suitable for plain-text emails, often used for simple notifications or updates.

2. **Define Your Contact Groups:**

   * Specify the groups of recipients you want to target with your emails. You can create multiple groups based on different criteria (e.g., customer segments, location, interests).

**After configuring these settings, the system will generate a unique URL for your API endpoint.**

**To send emails using this endpoint:**

1. **Generate an API Token:** Obtain an API token from your account settings.

2. **Make API Calls:** Use the generated API URL and your token to make API calls, providing the necessary data (e.g., recipient list, email content) for each email you want to send.

**By following these steps, you can effectively automate your email sending process and deliver your messages to the right people at the right time.**
